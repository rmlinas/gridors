![Illustration of a tomato plant with various pests and diseased fruits; sustainable gardening.]()
Organic pest management uses prevention, beneficial insects, and targeted natural remedies.
Organic pest control focuses on prevention and ecological balance. Maintain healthy soil and plants. Encourage beneficial insects by planting diverse flowers. Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick pests or use a strong water stream.  Organic solutions like neem oil, insecticidal soap, or diatomaceous earth can be used. Companion planting can deter pests. Good garden hygiene disrupts pest life cycles.  For more solutions, explore our [Organic Pest Control Tips](/guides/garden-guides/beginner): practical tips and techniques for organic pest control.

### How do I identify and manage common plant diseases organically?
Organic disease management involves choosing resistant varieties, ensuring proper air circulation, maintaining soil health, and promptly removing affected plant parts.
Organic disease control focuses on prevention. Select disease-resistant varieties. Ensure adequate spacing for air circulation. Maintain optimal soil health. Avoid overhead watering. Remove diseased plant parts promptly. Organic fungicides can be used as a last resort. Recognize early symptoms for timely intervention. Choosing disease-resistant varieties significantly reduces the risk of plant diseases.



<Image src={garden_guides_your_comprehensive_hub_for_sustainable_home_gardening_20250709201655_3278_img} alt="Retro-futuristic illustration of diverse people companion planting in a thriving garden, showcasing sustainable gardening practices.  Warm lighting, earthy tones, and subtle humor emphasize resourcefulness and self-sufficiency." width={1536} height={1536}/>

### What is companion planting and how does it work?
Companion planting involves growing specific plants together for mutual benefits, such as pest deterrence, improved growth, and attracting beneficial insects.
Companion planting uses the natural interactions between plants. Some plants, when grown together, positively influence each other. For example, marigolds near tomatoes deter nematodes.  Legumes fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting nearby plants.  This method reduces reliance on synthetic inputs. Research companion planting pairs specific to your plants.  See our [Companion Planting Guide](/guides/companion-planting) for more details.

## Harvesting and Preserving Your Produce
Harvesting and preserving your produce lets you enjoy it year-round.  Harvest most vegetables in the early morning after the dew has dried.  Check seed packets for specific harvest times.

## Common Challenges & Troubleshooting for Organic Gardeners
Even experienced gardeners face challenges. Understanding common mistakes and troubleshooting organically prevents discouragement.

### ❌ What Are Common Organic Gardening Mistakes and How to Avoid Them?
Common mistakes include overwatering, planting too early, overcrowding plants, and neglecting soil quality.
Overwatering leads to root rot. Plant warm-season crops after the last frost. Overcrowding restricts airflow and invites diseases. Neglecting soil quality is a foundational error. Keep a garden journal.

### My organic plants aren't growing – what could be wrong?
If plants aren't growing, check for inadequate sunlight, poor soil fertility, improper watering, nutrient deficiencies, or pests/diseases.
Check sunlight (at least 6-8 hours). Assess soil (compacted? enough organic matter?). Check watering (overwatering or underwatering). Look for pests or diseases. Extreme temperatures can halt growth. A soil test can help.
